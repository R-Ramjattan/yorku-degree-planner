Emerging models for new modes of fiction, doc and alternative projects are studied, exploring how new production models for 360/XR, i-doc, locative media, games and hybrid projects can learn from the best practices and expertise of low-budget and independent media idioms.\n\nEach class includes three components:  (1) in-depth instruction on some aspect of new media production; (2) the presentation of student research projects, conducting case-studies on the creative production of recent projects; and (3) a guest lecture by an industry professional (producers, funders, distributors), addressing their own experience in relation to that week's specialized topic.\n\nWorking in teams as their final project assignment, each student creates a detailed development package (proposal, budget, financing plan) for an original new media/independent cinema project. \n\nPre-requisite: FILM 3101 or permission of instructor. Each applicant must submit a current creative CV (with a focus on previous relevant experience in the arts), and a brief one-page letter outlining their interest in this course, and how it applies to their future careers (as producers and/or artists)."
