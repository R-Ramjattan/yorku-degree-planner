Lectures, guest speakers, and field trips address a variety of topics such as an evaluation of graduate programs, grant writing, contracts, copyright / intellectual property, exhibition proposals, research practices and skills, networking, social media promotion, documentation archive, marketing and business development. \r\n Students evolve individual plans for transitioning from undergraduate study to post graduate study or work by researching and analyzing the requirements and limitations of opportunities relevant to their current practice and future goals."
