Drawing on classical and contemporary philosophy and theory we will explore how education is concerned with cultivating the human and the possibility of a common world. To wonder again about what education is for in an existential, political and ethical sense we will ask about the nature of authority, power and freedom, about what justifies and bounds our interactions in education, and about the possibility of fostering the philosophical soul."

It studies the influence of those who lack direct authority over educational institutions but who may well influence the agendas and policy choices of governments, school boards, post-secondary educational decision-making bodies. Specifically, it looks at parent councils, lobby groups, teacher unions, business representatives, and Aboriginal associations. By way of illustration, it explores the topics of special education and the politics of race and schooling and it assesses the role of the media in shaping educational perspectives. Finally, it looks at policy-making in post-secondary education as well as the relationships between institutions (i.e. colleges, universities) and the communities in which they are located.
