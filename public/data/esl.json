            "name": "Modes of Reasoning: Reasoning In Everyday Language",
            "prereqs": "",
            "desc": "This course is structured to enhance the continued learning and language proficiency of ESL students. Students are exposed to theory and skills that foster critical reading, writing, speaking, thinking, and reasoning. Students apply theory and skills to the analysis of timely culturally relevant social, ethical, and/or pop culture issues. Given the smaller class size, students can expect opportunities of continued experiential education built into the course. Finally, students can expect to see real improvement in their abilities to be both respectfully curious individuals and reasonable skeptics - practices that are helpful in other academic courses and life generally. Students who have been admitted to York University with an ESL requirement, or can demonstrate an ESL need, will be given permission to enrol in this course. Contact the Department of Philosophy or course instructor (Lcarozza@yorku.ca) for guidance. Course credit exclusions: AP/MODR 1730 6.0; AP/MODR 1760 6.0; AP/MODR 1770 6.0; AP/PHIL 2200 3.0; GL/MODR 1711 6.0 (this does not include course codes prior to 2009 in AS and AK). Note: This course has been approved in the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies for general education credit: Humanities or Social Science."
