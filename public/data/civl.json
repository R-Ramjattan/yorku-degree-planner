The course will cover topics such as traditional freight modelling assumptions, the demand for goods movement arising from economic markets, trip generation models, truck movement models such as truck tours, societal impacts of freight, and future impacts of connected and autonomous (CAV) vehicles. In addition, the course will introduce students to optimization problems such as the transportation problem, p-median, and capacitated plant. Prerequisites: LE/CIVL 3250 3.00 or LE/CIVL 3260 3.00"
