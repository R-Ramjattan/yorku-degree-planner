With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?"

            "desc": "The term, multilingual education, typically refers to the teaching of and through more than two languages. This means that multilingual education is concerned with language policy. Language choices and uses in education reflect social policy decisions within a multicultural or cross-cultural context. In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneaously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-glabal communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages."
