In the knowledge-intensive economy, intellectual assets like human capital, intellectual property, brands, and trademarks are becoming an increasingly important proportion of a firm's total wealth. And yet, most firms do a poor job of managing intellectual capital strategically.  In this course, we adopt a &quot;lifecycle&quot; approach to the management of an intellectual asset.  This lifecycle covers the creation of the intellectual asset, the codification of the asset in the form of intellectual property (IP), the valuation of intellectual assets, the protection of intellectual assets, and leveraging of intellectual assets."
