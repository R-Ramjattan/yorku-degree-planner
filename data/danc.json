Guided instruction in each dance form is complemented by opportunities to improvise and engage in creative explorations and choreography. Resources for each module may include podcasts, interviews, readings, video recordings and other tools to provide socio-historical context for each form. \n\nThis course addresses issues such as cultural policies, hybridized and/or hyphenated identity and processes of adaptation and acculturation. Together each dance form is a basis for understanding how dance functions as a bridge to diasporic identity. In addition to learning the movements and culture of multiple dances, students will also have the opportunity to research the dances of their own cultural heritage. No previous dance experience required."
