Live performance is the culmination of an extended learning process and time period and the goal of this event, the replication of those skills so easily demonstrated in the studio, is often marred the debilitating effects of performance anxiety. The resulting performance results in an inaccurate assessment of the student\u0092s learning and is a misrepresentation of their intended representation/interpretation of the music. Each student will investigate and define their level of anxiety from mild to severe, and through the identification of cognitive distortions will apply various strategies, physical and psychological, to overcome their performance anxiety. Open to non-majors."
