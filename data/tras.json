By focusing on the voice of the translator, the aim is to capture and analyze how it leaves its mark in the text, the reception and the discourse on translation.\r\n"

Case studies of Balzac in English and in Chinese serve as a basis of study of his translation/reception in other languages and/or countries.\r\n\r\nPartant des th\u00e9ories de la r\u00e9ception (Jauss, Iser) et des approches culturelles plus r\u00e9centes en traductologie (Bassnett, Lefevere), ce cours mettra en lumi\u00e8re quelques-unes des questions, politiques, sociales, historiques et autres qui d\u00e9terminent la traduction d'un auteur \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger. Des \u00e9tudes de cas sur Balzac en anglais et en chinois serviront de base \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude de la r\u00e9ception de Balzac dans d'autres langues et/ou pays.\r\n\r\nNote: The language of instruction will be French when the course is offered by the Graduate Program in French/Francophone Studies, and may be French or English when the course is offered by the Graduate Program in Translation Studies.\r\nWhen offered by the Graduate Program in French/Francophone Studies, more emphasis is put on the analysis of the source text."

Students will experience how expanded understandings of cultural translation and textuality have radically altered and expanded the Eurocentric character of the discipline.\r\n\r\nQuestions for investigation includes: How have the aesthetics and politics of Comparative Literature changed over the past two hundred years? What factors have influenced those changes? How is World Literature related to Comparative Literature? How do both relate to colonial, post-colonial, diasporic, cultural and translation studies and digital humanities?"
