The workshop will also be useful to those writing a Significant Research Paper (SRP) (30 pages) as the method of evaluation in a course. The Workshop is offered every term and allows students to complete modules on legal research and writing that support the development of skills for long graduate research papers.  Several live online sessions will be held throughout the term to afford students the opportunity for discussion about their research projects and to ask questions of a research and writing instructor.  There will be an opportunity to receive feedback on research and writing skills. To get the most out of the course, it is recommended that students take it after successfully completing at least one or two terms of the program and have a topic in mind for their MRP or SRP."

            "desc": "This course is divided into two sections, Part I (Legal Research) and Part II (Legal Writing).\n\nPart I (Legal Research) - Description Part I of this course teaches students the basic techniques of legal research relevant to Canadian Law, which is essential for legal studies and is a fundamental tool of the lawyering profession in Canada. In this course, students will learn the different categories of legal information and how they are published, organized, and indexed. In addition to learning traditional research methods, students will also be trained to use computer-assisted legal research, including major legal databases such as LexisNexis/Quicklaw, Westlaw Canada, and CCH Online. The purpose of Part I of this course is also to provide international graduate students with the essential skills to identify, locate, and understand legal materials relevant to business scenarios around the world. Therefore, not only Canadian, but also the US, foreign, and international legal research resources will be reviewed. \n\nPart II (Legal Writing) - Description Fundamentally, the materials, classes and evaluation methods for Part II of the course are designed to: (1) assist students to use the legal research skills acquired in Part I to create legal documents; (2) assist students to acquire the tools required to perform sound legal writing; (3) assist students to develop ways to analyze legal problems that will be applied both during and after the IBL program; and (4) assist students to use provided frameworks to create a range of commonly used legal documents within the Canadian legal system. During Part II of the course, students will have the opportunity to complete a number of assignments which progressively build upon analytical and writing skills. The primarily assignment-based nature of this part of the course requires a significant and &quot;steady&quot; time commitment"
