Students will not be allowed to enroll in a biology research practicum course with their Honours Thesis (SC/BIOL 4000 8.00) supervisor during the same terms that they are enrolled in SC/BIOL 4000 8.00. Students will be required to obtain safety training, such as WHMIS, if appropriate to the type of research undertaken. The course is intended only for students in Biology or Biochemistry majors."

Adopting a comparative approach, the course focuses on highly specialized sensory systems and unusual, often surprising solutions to sensory challenges. \n Sensory systems are explored with respect to the function, the principles of the underlying information processing, and their physiological implementation in the organism. To understand the value of specialized sensory systems, the course also discusses the context in which sensory systems are used, and the constraints that may limit their evolution. \nTechnical solutions to sensory problems in robotics are discussed and compared to those invented by natural evolution. \nTheories covered include Bayesian Inference, Ideal Observer Theory, and Control Theory. Discussion of original literature and examples that showcase the reality of empirical science are used whenever appropriate.  Prerequisites: SC/BIOL 3060 4.00 or HH/PSYC 2220 3.00."
